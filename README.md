# Tic Tac Toe Game

**Description:**
This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, designed to be played against an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm. The game offers an interactive command-line interface where the player can make moves by specifying the row and column of the cell they want to mark.

## Features:
- Player vs. AI gameplay.
- Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making.
- Simple command-line interface for interaction.
- Ability to play as 'X' or 'O'.

## How to Play:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter the row and column numbers when prompted to make your move.

## Files Included:
- `tic_tac_toe.py`: The Python script containing the game logic and user interface.
- `README.md`: Instructions and information about the project (you're reading it now!).
- (Optional) Other supporting files, if any.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
